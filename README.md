# Minimization-of-Differences-of-Sums-of-Primes-
The SumMin program takes an integer, n, as the user input. This integer corresponds to the first n primes.
Then the minimization of the sum |±2±3±...±p_n| is found using the minSum(primes) function where p_n is the nth prime. In all cases (directly verified for all n up to n = 10,000 as well as isolated cases such as n = 10,000,000 and n = 11,000,002) that have been considered, this sum is either 0, 1 or 2. For all even n so far tested the sum can be minimized to 1.
